Option 1 — Host Your HTML Form in SharePoint (No Server Needed)

There are two ways to host HTML in SharePoint:

A. Upload the HTML file and embed it on a modern page

B. Use a Script Editor Web Part to paste the HTML directly

I’ll show you both, starting with the easiest.

⭐ A. Method 1 — Upload HTML File + Embed It (Recommended)

Save your form as:

move-request.html

Make sure the Power Automate URL is already inserted in the JavaScript.

Step 2 — Upload the HTML file to SharePoint

Open Site Contents

Open the Site Assets library

Upload your move-request.html file

You now have a hosted URL like:

https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/SiteAssets/move-request.html

Copy this URL.

Step 3 — Create a SharePoint Page

Go to Site Pages

Click New → Site Page

Search for Embed

Paste the URL to your HTML file

SharePoint will automatically render your form inside the page.
